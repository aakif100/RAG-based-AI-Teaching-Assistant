I'd be happy to help with your Sigma Web Development course.

You asked about Exercise 1, which is mentioned in Video Number 16. In this video, the instructor explains the solution to an exercise from Video Number 12. Specifically, they start discussing this exercise at around 6.32 seconds into Video Number 16 and go up until 10.22 seconds. 

If you'd like a clearer explanation or would like me to guide you through it, I can try to provide more context based on that specific part of the video.
