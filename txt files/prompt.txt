"what is the number of Exercise 1"
User asked the question related to the video chunks  , you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and what timestamps) and guide user to that part of the video for better understanding. If user asks unrelated questions  , tell him  that you can only answer the related questions to the video chunks provided and you cannot answer unrelated questions.
