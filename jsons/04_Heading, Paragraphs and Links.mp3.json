    "text": " In today's video, I'll tell you about heading and paragraphs along with that, I'll also tell you about anchor text If you found this course awesome, then do like this video Your likes will help me in getting such free courses In this video, we'll make a small project which will be a bookmark website This bookmark website will help you in getting all your favorite websites together and you'll be able to use it in actual So let's start quickly Write in the comments below, sigma batch OP Let's roll the intro Intro music So guys, as you can see, I'm in my computer screen and if you haven't accessed the playlist yet, then you can do so One more thing I want to tell you is that if you go to github.com or repository then you'll get a GitHub repo of sigma web dev course I've made a folder for all the videos and I've made a commit according to the folder So do access this folder so that you can get the source code I'll also put the source code in the description so there's no problem Now we'll make a very basic website but it'll be very important for us because it'll be our first useful website So without taking too much time I'll make a new folder in this sigma web dev folder and I'll name it video4 because it's our fourth video So I'll make it with the name video4 by clicking on shift right and open with code so that the folder opens in our VS code After doing this, I'll do what we always do index.html, main.css, style.css and along with that, script.js We usually make these 3 files If I write css, I'll put it here If I write script, I'll put it here but for now, I'll just write an exclamation mark here and write something like this in the document my bookmarks So we're going to make a bookmark website and I'll write code with that here So you must have seen such titles Now I'll write h1 here Now what happens with h1? You can add headings to your web page with h1 We talked about the basic structure We said that it tells that this is an HTML page html lang is equal to en lang is an attribute and its value is en which means that the content of this page is in English and it tells this to search engines or if anyone is using this web page link then they'll know that this web page is in English and they can parse this web page accordingly the browser will also know that your web page is in English Now here we have a head with metadata which is the title of the page which CSS link is there all these things are information the main content is in the body Now to add headings to the body, there is a tag called h1 and I'm going to write my bookmarks in it So if I write my bookmarks here then we'll write this with h1 tag and if I want to live this here I'll click here and then I'll open it in browser so you can see how my bookmarks are visible Now why should we always use h1? Why didn't I write my bookmarks directly? Because I'm telling the browser that this is my heading and this is my first level heading Now suppose I want to keep two kinds of bookmarks in my bookmarks one is main bookmarks and the other is secondary bookmarks so I'll use h2, which is the heading of the second level so if you've used Microsoft word, you'll know what h1 and h2 are but if you don't know then I'll tell you that h1 is your main level heading and the other level heading is from h2 suppose I say main bookmarks and secondary bookmarks I'll do something like this and I'll press ALT, SHIFT and DOWN arrow I'll do one thing, why didn't I turn on screencast mode? so what I did here is I pressed ALT, SHIFT and DOWN arrow so this is replicated, this is the shortcut of VS Code I want to tell you one more shortcut of VS Code that if you press ALT in your keyboard and then wherever you click, there will be a cursor suppose I click here, then only one cursor will appear but if I click on ALT and if I click on other place, then there will be a cursor suppose I want to make all bookmarks code with Harry so my bookmarks dash code with Harry I can write something like this how did I do this? I clicked here, then I pressed ALT and wherever I click, there will be multiple cursor then whatever I type will appear in multiple cursor wherever there are cursor, whatever I type will appear isn't it fun? Like this so I'll remove it like this and you'll see that it'll be updated so this is my main heading, this is my h2 similarly, from h1 to h2, we have heading up to h6 suppose you gave a main heading after main heading, you gave a secondary heading then after that, you have to give some heading in that too and so on, you have to give a lot of subheadings then you can give heading up to h6 h6 is more than enough in HTML headings are up to h6, you'll never need h7 in practical life, if we talk about it and if you keep on reading, you can use h6 repeatedly because it becomes so small after h1 that h6 will become so small so it won't be so small now what I'll do here I'll replicate it with alt shift down arrow key and I'll click here, press alt I'm telling you all these shortcuts so that your productivity increases now I've put two cursor here and here I'll press backspace and make it h3 then I'll click here, press alt and make it h4 and I'll click here, click here and make it h5 then I'll click here, click here and I'll make it h6 so it's up to h6 now what I'll do here I'll write using h1 so that you can see and I'll write using here I'll press space, write using, write h and now I have to click here and write 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and you can see it looks like this so you know that h1 is like this h2 is like this, h3 is small h4 is small, h5 is small, h6 is small and what will happen if h6 is small it'll be over in a while so h6 is more than enough so I'll show you a practical demonstration of this so suppose this is my HTML tutorial so here I've given the main heading html introduction, then I've given what is html, then features of html I've given this from h1, this from h2 then if something comes in h2 then I've given it from h3 then if something comes in h2, then I've given h3 like here the term why the term hypertext and markup language was here, this is heading 2 then what is the main heading page? html introduction so I've given h3 in h1 so I've given h3 in h2 then h2 is back so in building the hierarchy h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 are used I hope you've understood many people are commenting that you're starting too slow so I'm making this course as a beginner course when I tell you html then you'll say yes, it's very easy then I'll tell you a little CSL then I'll tell you JavaScript then you'll say yes, it's a little easy then I'll tell you bootstrap then you'll say yes, it's a little difficult then I'll tell you React then note JS then I'll take things to MongoDB MySQL then one time the level will go up I told you we'll raise the bar so when we'll do React when we'll make projects when we'll do dangerous things then I'll ask them for their comments so don't talk about the level the level is going to go up so these are our headings 6 headings which I'll keep now if we want to write paragraphs then we can use the P tag we'll hit enter and it'll come now let me tell you a shortcut trick if you want to write dummy paragraphs in Emett through VS Code you'll write here I wrote Lorem23 and here you'll see the Emett abbreviation it'll give me 23 words you can do a word wrap on the view then you won't get horizontal scroll bar so do a view word wrap now here you'll see Lorem Epsom DollarSit here's a dummy text why do we want dummy text sometimes because we're making a template and we have to fill that template with something for example you're making a website which looks like OYO Rooms now here OYO become a member OYO for business I don't have to write all this I wrote Lorem now I'll write Lorem I'll hit enter with Lorem7 then I'll give it to OYO and they'll do the same so here you can use it to fill the placeholder my plan is to make clones of popular websites so that you know how things work this is also a popular website if you've used their services then do let me know in the comment section now we'll see other things like paragraphs how to style them and all these are done through CSS now in paragraphs when I wrote Lorem23 this is the text now I'll hit P to enter if I write Lorem10 then only 10 words will come and if I want to write Lorem100 then I can do that so this Lorem trick is very good and whenever we make a clone of popular websites let's say I make a clone of Amazon.in so here I have to write something here's a lot of text so I have to write something here I can't see much text let's say I have to write 3 words so I'll write Lorem3 I'll write Lorem4 or Lorem3 or Lorem2 and I'll make a template and then whatever comes after that will come from my database and I can bring it in different ways many people asked if this course will be job ready the answer is yes I'll make you guys able to do the actual industry level jobs and you'll be able to do it through its learning now let's talk about the attributes in HTML these are the attributes in HTML like I used the HTML tag lang is equal to en, lang is an attribute we didn't use any attribute in body we didn't use any attribute in h1 we didn't use any attribute in p but I can use a style attribute in p which is called inline cssb if I make the background color red something like this then its background color will be red this is called inline cssb style is equal to if you add css in the style attribute we had learned to add css in the style attribute but if you add style is equal to then you'll get this background red let me show you I'll make it teal or this color this color looks good I can also add style inline but when you make industry level websites we use inline styles very less because maintainability and reusability is less so we want to ship small bundles on the browser and our website is more optimized so we avoid all these things but inline css style is a tag but here style is an attribute p is a tag p tag has an attribute style through which we can style this element we'll talk about many other attributes attributes basically enhance an element's functionality for example, we gave this paragraph a style which was background color thizzle to give this background color we used style attribute in this way to give properties we use this type of attribute for example we talked about link link colon css link has relic attribute so with this attribute we can use this css style sheet for example background color I'll say body first what we need in body background color and don't worry about this because css style will tell you but I'll tell you that I use hot pink another functionality of vs code this ninja technique will be very useful hover mouse and choose any color you want like this and do like this so here is my body's background color how did you like ninja technique write in comments now here we are back in index.html I can remove this I'll comment it out so it won't be style sheet which is very natural this background color is very natural here I did style is equal to background color so it was visible now we'll make bookmark manager bookmark manager.html and I'm making this because I've told you different headings I'm going to make a useful bookmark manager so I'll write bookmark manager now you'll say that this bookmark manager is available in chrome this is made by us we made it so you'll have a different love for it because this is you made it yourself you made one software so it's different now you can see bookmark manager code with area I'll write h1 and my bookmarks now I'll write h2 here I'll write primary bookmarks and I'll write secondary bookmarks in fact if I press alt shift bottom space and write secondary bookmarks so what will happen I can write secondary bookmarks now I'll write google or I'll write google like this we'll write it from list but in upcoming videos I'll tell you how to use list for now you can think like this google, suppose I write google open google and I'll use anchor tag so as I enter in A A has a mandatory attribute href, href means click and go to which link so href is equal to https colon double slash www.google.com and I'll click on this and I'll cut this and put it here so the content of this tag will be like this and here you can see href is equal to eia open google this is called anchor tag which helps us to make links you must have seen many links like this now you can see here as soon as I go to bookmark manager.html you can see here that you can see all the bookmarks open google now you can see one thing you noticed when I didn't click on this it was blue, now I visited it so its color changed so its color changes when you visit it so it has converted to a visited link so I know that I have visited it now I'll tell you one more thing if we want it to open in new tab like I'm clicking on this it's opening in the same tab if you want to open it in new tab then you have two ways either you can click on this mouse wheel or you can click on this now I'll tell you another way if you want it to open in new tab then you can use an attribute you can write here target is equal to underscore blank and we get suggestions from vscode so I wrote it by hitting two enter if you write it in notepad or any other editor then what happens to you it's cheap according to quality if you use a cheap editor then target is equal to underscore blank you have to type it completely it's a pain but if you write it in any way then I'll click on it I'm not clicking on the mouse wheel I'll click on it and it's in new tab I'll click on the mouse wheel and it's in new tab so I can open it like this I've written a simple open google if you want you can use your favorite website whatever is your favorite you can use it I've used good websites now I'll write open facebook and here you can see www.facebook.com and I'll write kora.com and codewithery.com and after this let's say youtube.com let's see if it's coming or not you can see it's coming in one line if you want it to not come in one line then what you'll do you'll put it in your paragraphs it's a very dirty way I'll tell you why I'm calling it dirty way but you can enclose it in a paragraph if you want I'll press shift and right arrow I'll press control x and then I'll press end all the cursors will go to end because if you press end on one cursor then it goes to end and I'll press control v I've used this shortcut a lot and some of you will be like what did I do if you don't give begin but I simply used the vs code multiple cursor functionality I've used multiple cursors by pressing alt this is not a good way we never make a list by using this we use list but because we haven't read the list we're using paragraphs but this will do our job and the ones we haven't visited are blue we've visited facebook and it's color is purple we've visited kora and it's color is purple so these are your primary bookmarks what will be your secondary bookmarks we'll put 2 secondary bookmarks your secondary bookmarks are those that you visit sometimes wikipedia.com and let's say stackoverflow.com we'll write the spelling correctly stackoverflow let's capitalize stackoverflow and now you can see your wikipedia and stackoverflow in secondary bookmarks so this is your bookmark manager and you can make it better we'll learn more about CSS so if you think it's ugly don't worry about it don't worry about it because we'll talk about it in the future we'll talk about designing for now, your bookmark looks like this bookmark manager code with hr is your title and I'll write it in h1 so both will be same our title and h1 and my bookmarks code with hr will also be same so you can make a bookmark manager like this you can use it in actual now if you save it like this like this bookmark manager.html you can copy it and put it on your desktop then whenever you want to open a website you just double click it if it opens with a double click then you'll have to right click it open with it then choose another app and then choose google chrome and always do it so whenever I double click it it'll open with google chrome so this was our bookmark manager I hope you liked it I have a request from you today we've completed 4 videos so if you liked the course I want you to share it with your friends I know very few people will share it but I'll try to bring more courses like this many people are shocked and say how is this course free how will you earn money I'll find some other ways to make more money but the thing is I'll mark this course as the best course for web development I'll put everything in it and I'll teach you in the least amount of time many ad techs were angry with me many companies told me to launch a paid course on our platform I won't take the name but many companies are angry with me as I launch paid courses why are you doing this, you'll regret your decision but hopefully I won't regret my decision to make this course free I'll earn money in other ways and I'll teach you in this course how you can earn more money with that said I'll put its source code in the description or you can take it from this repository that's it for today thank you so much for watching this video and I'll see you next time"
