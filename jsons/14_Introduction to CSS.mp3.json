    "text": " Guys, we are going to start with CSS in this video. We have gone ahead in this course. We have completed the entire HTML. And some of you have shown a lot of enthusiasm. Don't decline your interest in this video. Like this video and write in the comments section with high energy sigma batch op. We have to maintain such high energy throughout the course. CSS stands for cascading style sheets. And with the help of cascading style sheets, we supplement HTML with some styles. HTML was never intended to create styled pages. The purpose of HTML was to create a basic website structure. And then CSS takes the responsibility of styling the page. CSS has selectors that help in selecting any element. In this video, I will tell you what a selector is, how CSS is written. In the upcoming videos, we are going to raise the bar like anything. We will create real-world websites. And websites like Amazon, Flipkart, Netflix, YouTube, all these websites will be capable of creating. So guys, I am very excited. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come to my computer screen. As always, I will create a folder here. And I will create a folder named video14. It's a lot of fun in this course. Because honestly speaking, I have never created a course of this level. Now here I will tell you about CSS. Why would you use CSS? HTML was never intended to create web pages. HTML was always intended to create a skeleton. There were many tags in HTML that were deprecated. Like font tag. Because HTML was the responsibility of creating a skeleton website. That's about it. After that, CSS had to handle all the work. In this video, we will create real-world websites. And if you haven't accessed the playlist, you can do that as well. All the source codes are available here. Go to codewithhari.com. If you go there, you can download HTML notes. You will get to see additional things. So you will click on PDF notes. You will get to see PDF notes of HTML. These are handwritten notes written by me. I have put a lot of effort in writing them. So you can download them. I will add a link in the description. One more thing I want to mention. If HTML is the body of a car, meaning the frame of a car, then CSS is the paint, decoration, designs, seeds, interior of a car. And JavaScript is the engine and internal logic. We will talk about engine and internal logic later. We have completed HTML. Now, we will talk about CSS. Now, I will tell you some more examples. Like, you have a human body. A human body is a skeleton. You can think of a skeleton as HTML. Skin, hair, etc. You can think of CSS as such. And our brain, nerves, neurons, they constitute JavaScript. So I hope you have understood this. So, HTML was never intended to style websites. CSS took this responsibility. CSS said, HTML is enough for you. Now I have come and I will help you in styling. CSS took the responsibility of styling the pages. So, you must download HTML notes. Spoiler alert, CSS notes are very expensive. But listen to me first. Then download. I have given you the spoiler. But don't download now. I have taken this a lot of time and effort. So, you are going to get a lot of things. And I am enjoying this level of course. So, if I right click on the shift and click on Open with Code, then this video14 folder opens in my VS Code. Now, if I make a file called index.html and exclamation mark it and put a boilerplate code. Like we were doing this in our HTML course. If we do it like in HTML videos, and if I write CSS in the title, and if I write a div in the body, and if I write, Hey, I am Harry and today I am in CSS mood. So, if I click on preview, you can see here, Hey, I am Harry and today I am in CSS mood. So, what is CSS? CSS is basically you can add using style tech. There are two other ways which I will tell you in the coming videos. I will tell you a lot of things. Now, if I say that, Look, the div, the color of the div is red. Let's say I say this. I said what? That the color of the div is red. So, in this div, the div is the selector and this is our declaration. So, selector and declaration. The selector is the div. That is, the color of all the divs in this page, which is our key, this is our value, this is our property, this is the value of that property. Make the color red. So, this is our declaration and this is our selector. I hope you understood. So, now if I show you the page, see, the color of this page is red. Because I said that the color of the div in this page is red. So, if I make another div here, and if I write I am good in it, then the color of I am good will also be red. As you can see. And if I put another declaration in this, and if I write background yellow, then here, its background is also yellow. Its background is also yellow. Whoever matches this selector, the background of that element will be yellow. As you can see here, I said div. And here, this was a div and this was a div. If I make a span here, and I write I am also good, then what will happen? Will this also be red? No, this color will not be red. Because this selector and these declarations are not applicable on these elements. Okay? No element is a div. Okay? If I put a paragraph here, and put Lorem435 in it, oops, I think 435 is too much. 43 is enough. Okay? So here I put a big Lorem, which will make our page bigger. This declaration was not applied in this. It was not applied in this also. I only said div. That's why all these conditions were applied in div. Now I can put a comma here and select multiple elements. I can say, do this in both div and span. Div and span will be red in both. And here the background color will be yellow. Div and span are my selectors. So, in all selectors, this declaration was applied. This is the property. Background color is the property, whose value is yellow. Color is the property, whose value is red. Okay? So here you can see, wherever there will be div, wherever there will be span, this thing will be applied there. And that's pretty much how CSS works. That's it. Now what we'll learn in the coming videos, that this is done with this property, and this is done with this selector. I'll tell you about different types of selectors. That's about it. It's as simple as that. And using these selectors, we can create websites like Amazon, Flipkart, Facebook, and also websites like Instagram. And nowadays, there are so many technologies in the market through which you can make mobile apps by coding like this. We'll explore all these things. This course is going to be very extensive. We'll be touching so many things. I gave you an exercise in video number 12. So if you haven't posted your answer, please post it as soon as possible. Because I'm going to shout out whoever will post their answer in the comment section. So make sure you go to video 12 and solve the exercises of Pure HTML Player. Because if there's a two-way interaction, it'll be fun. There will be talks from both sides. I'll shout out to you from here. You'll have fun solving it. So please solve it. Now I want to tell you about Replet. Many people say that they don't have a laptop or a phone. Many people have problems. Replet is an amazing platform which you can try out. You just have to sign up here and you'll be able to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript here. And it works really well. I've used it for my production-grade projects. And I've made a lot of videos on this channel. So we've done 100 days of code on Replet. So you can use it if you don't have a laptop. You can use it if you don't have a laptop. It'll be a great experience. So please write in the comment section if you're enjoying this course or not. Because I want to hear your comments in the comment section. Make sure you access this playlist. And also access the source code. I've updated all the sources of the videos. And please name your villages and lands. That's it for this video. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I'll see you next time. Bye."
