    "text": " In this video, we will know what are the forms and what is the input tag in the form Using the form is an important element of websites because you submit data from client to server through the form These are the forms which you see on contact pages, google forms or enquiry forms The details of the flight or railway ticket, date and time, where to go and where to go are submitted through the HTML forms In the last video, very few people liked it I will request you to like this video with high energy so that we can maintain high energy throughout the course So let's go to the computer screen and see the forms, input tags and some best practices Let's roll the intro So guys, I have come to my computer screen and now see I am going to make a folder here quickly whose name I am going to keep as video 6 because this is the 6th video, I will click on shift right and open with code I have already told you all this and here I am going to make index.html and with an exclamation mark in it I will do view, word wrap, screen, smote, and here I will write forms Let's learn it So I have set the title of this forms page and by setting the title, you can see the actual title on our page Here I want to tell you an important setting of the show preview and some of you guys have also pointed out in the comments that we have to click so many times, can we do something? Yes, you can click on gear, then on settings and after that, simply write live preview and we can actually set it such that whenever we click on it, it will open on the external browser so now I will close everything and as soon as I click on it, it will open on the external browser and I will come to my browser and the sigma web development codes playlist you can access it by clicking on star or bookmark but now I want to tell you that as soon as we click on it it will open so if you want to do this, then do it but sometimes you will want to do side by side view and when you want to do that, you can do it by using HTML CSS and working on the design so whenever you are working on the design you will definitely want to see the live previews which is why this extension was made and this live server was made different so that you can see the previews on the side now what we will do here about the forms what is a form? you know the name, form means like a railway form, we fill it and our reservation is done along with that, we fill the form of IIT JEE need form, any exam form so that our data can reach those who want it so this is a form HTML is a form tag as soon as you write a form, you will enter so the first question will be what is the action of your form? get or post? there is a quick difference between get request and post request we will see this later when we will read the backend get request is a very simple request and post request is when we have to send in most of the cases when we have to give a lot of data like whenever our form is post so in most of the cases we will use post request and what is get request? it is a very simple request that we just have to tell the server something and that's it or we have to hit the server with a request that's it but if you still don't understand this that should be fine there is no problem because we will do this in detail later so form action is equal to post I have written it here now I can show you some input tags I will tell you what are the input tags that will be in your form what elements will come like you can put date you can put in the form tell the name you can say phone number you can say your age it can be just number you can put such things in the form so I want to tell you that the input tag you put in the form and there is a label tag which is used to label the input so what I will do here you see the simplest input tag is type is equal to text so I will put the type is equal to text input here and you see here if I zoom out and show you so here input type is equal to text name is equal to username placeholder is entering in username and it will look like this you can say enter your username and the user will have to enter his username I will write an h1 here and I will write form to apply for sigma web dev ta sigma web development codes ta suppose we are hiring teaching assistants for sigma web development codes so we can write something like this by the way I have put subtitles if you haven't access the playlist then do it and I will show you one more thing the subtitles are very funny I will show you then write sigma batch op and give your village land means if someone is watching this or someone who doesn't know Hindi he will say what happened till here and give your village land to me you can see this now you can see here I have put the h1 here which is our heading this is our main heading enter your username this is our input tag we use label tag now whose label is this so I will write its id for example I will write its id username and what I will do in for is equal to I will put its id now what is this id I will tell you this later for now you just understand this is a unique identifier of an element to identify this element uniquely like your Aadhar number cannot be of anyone else in the same way this id username has been obtained now it cannot be obtained by anyone else this is the id I will tell you more in detail but now just understand so I have written label for is equal to username this is the input and you can see here that the label will appear so here I am seeing I have not put anything in the label actually so I will enter your username and you can see as soon as I put this here you will see enter your username after that you can enter your username along with that you can enter your expertise you can put anything suppose I have to ask here what is your gender so I can do something like this and you see enter your gender and as soon as I do this I can ask you from male or female what is it now what happens here sometimes we wrap it in div what is div div is our block element ok and what are inline and block elements I have not told you in this course but I will tell you in the coming videos so for now you just understand to give a new space I am putting it in div ok so as soon as I put it in div it will come in new space yes br tag also happens ok br tag also happens because of which the line breaks but I don't prefer br tag and you will get to know why why we don't want to bloat our HTML with br tag you will get to know this in the coming videos now you see here enter your username male or female what is it now you see here as soon as I am clicking on female this radio button is selected I am clicking on male this is selected why is this happening because the label of this I have done for is equal to female and here I have put id female you see and along with that you see I have put the names of these two same here name is equal to gender I have also put this input tag and name is equal to gender is also input radio tag and as soon as we have type is equal to radio it means this is radio button and if we have made its name same then only one of these two can be selected at a time means if I select this then only this will happen if I select this then only this will happen now I will show you one thing if I make the id in the label form wrong and here also in the form I don't make the id wrong in the first one I make it wrong in the second one so when I click on the female of the second one see it won't be selected I am clicking it it is not selected I am clicking on male so to select female I have to click on this see so what I have to do is always put the id of the input tag which is equal to 4 so you can see here I have put the label 4 is equal to female along with that we have an input tag which is type is equal to check box now see here if I put the type is equal to check box input I will put this in div and right click format document as soon as I do our document will be very good means its formatting and indents will be very good now see here subscribe to newsletter here I can check it and radio button and check box the difference is that you can check check box different check box here if you want male or female or any of the options you can select it like this after this we have text area and select tag and I will show you that too so this is text area and select tag it works like this as soon as you copy text area I will put it here and show you text area so text area input type it works for text only but it has rows and column attributes which helps you to make it smaller now see here the placeholder inside it I have given it enter your comment here so I have given it text in it ideally we will keep it empty or we will not give it at least new line so I will paste it here enter your comment here and now it will reach to the left side I will show you so it has reached to the left side see enter your comment here and here any user can put his comment now see here I have put the content of text area here enter your comment here so you will not want to do this you will want to keep text area empty and you will want to put a label and you can say label for is equal to comment and definitely we will put the id here whenever we put for so it is inside for the id of the element which is there ok now see here enter your comment if I write here then what will happen if I write enter your comment then enter your comment then enter your comment will come here now you will say so this style is not there because we will style it with css later for now I will just put br tag but I don't recommend br tag I am telling you this again I don't recommend br tag at all because br tag causes problems by the way you should know br tag line break tag it causes line break something like this now you must be thinking everything is fine you must be thinking what is the problem in br tag but I will tell you br tag is something that I don't recommend ok it is not like this you don't have to use it but I don't recommend using it all the time just put br tag and add new spaces I oppose this so I will copy it and show you select tag something like this and you see here as soon as I put select tag I will put it in div so in select you get some options select syntax is something like this apple banana and you can use any of the three from cherry now you see here any of the three can be used and here what I did value is equal to apple first I made select tag name is equal to fruits then option value is equal to apple option value is equal to banana option value is equal to cherry when we will parse this form I will tell you in the javascript part how to send this data to the server so there are many things about form that I will tell you so stay tuned for that ok this was about forms I had to tell you all the elements of forms in this video and along with that I have told you select tag and all these things about form these other attributes like action I told you you can submit a form from action on any page and where it will handle the form so you can give that data here then method is get request or post request I will tell you the difference in the coming videos but I have told you in a very rough way that get request is a very simple request post request is used when you have to send big data to the server because get request has a limit you can send a lot of data in post request ok we don't even send passwords in get request we send it with the help of post request ok now here I have told you the method what happens in name name is equal to username means we mark it with name when we mark it with name then server will know which key is corresponding value so key value pair which will go to the server will go according to the name its name and value will go ok so we will see this when we will do server side processing what is the meaning of placeholder placeholder means what will be written inside it like here see the entry and username is placeholder if I click on this then this entry and username is not written inside it whatever I write see it came but entry and username is telling me that I have to put username in it then required means you have to require it you have to put value of it otherwise your form won't be submitted so we will use this a lot then after this we have autofocus what does autofocus do autofocus automatically focuses cursor so I will show you the magic of autofocus so if you have written autofocus in the input tag ok so I have written autofocus in entry and username now I will reload it so see I will type on it so if I type on it it will automatically focus on it ok so autofocus means whatever you type it will type on it ok I hope you are understanding things now validation attribute required here I have told you you can give pattern in which you can give regular expression pattern now you people don't get confused don't say what are you talking about we don't know regular expression so I am sitting here I will teach you all but you understand that we will accept a particular pattern only if we put pattern is equal to this then you can't put any other pattern ok so you should know this here so I hope you are enjoying this video and along with that please write sigma batch op in the comment section and in the first video please review this course because still many people ask me should I do this course or not if it is a free course then people don't value it they say this course is free so we should watch it or take a paid course and I would like to give a note to those people who told me that we took a paid course and they said that we took a paid course and they said that we took a paid course and what should we do now should we collect the money or should we join sigma batch you should join sigma batch cut your losses and join sigma batch because I don't think I need to tell you the quality of this course so you should come here and do this course and you will get everything I am telling you I don't know what free means I was going to sell this course for 10,000 rupees yes that was the amount which we fixed I was going to sell this course for 10,000 rupees and I think there is nothing wrong in selling any course if anyone is selling if anyone is selling there is nothing wrong in selling any course but the thing is if you have bought any other course and you still feel that sigma is a very good course which is there then you should join cut your losses and join because if you make your career then in future you won't need any of these things you will look back in the coming time and you will say yes we took a paid course and then we took a pre-course from which we understood and if you make a career then all these things won't matter in future so do what is right for you and do your work while understanding your mistakes I hope you are understanding things so like the video access the playlist subscribe to the channel and in the comment section below write sigma batch op and name your village and uncle's land in my name that's it for now in this video thank you so much guys for
