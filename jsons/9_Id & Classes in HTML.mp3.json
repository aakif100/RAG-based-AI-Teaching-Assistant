    "text": " In this video, I'll tell you about ID and classes. The concept of ID and classes is very confusing. In fact, when I was learning HTML in my early days, I was very confused about ID and classes. ID means unique identifier. If you give an ID to an element, then you won't give that ID to another element. But class means that if you want to give multiple elements, then you'll give it multiple classes. For example, you can give a class named red to a div and a form. Similarly, you can give a class named BG red to an article tag and a header tag. Do like this video because we'll now go to the computer screen and we'll see these things very closely. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, I'm back. If you haven't accessed the sigma web development codes, then you can access the playlist by clicking here. Click here to save and the source code is also being uploaded to github. Now I'll come to the folder and create a folder named video9. So I'll create a folder named video9. I'll type video9 and after that I'll right click on shift and open with code. And you can see that it's open in BS code. Now I'll type index.html and I'll enter with an exclamation mark. And I'll tell you guys what ID and classes are. Do you have an Aadhaar card? If you don't have it, then you must have some ID. Now don't write in the comments that you don't have ID. Whenever you go somewhere, you have to show your ID to prove your identity. That I'm this. Now if you want to understand about ID and classes in HTML, then ID is your identity. Okay. What is that? It's your identity. So listen to a story here. This is John and this is Harry. They are very good friends. They don't share their lunch and they are very good friends. They are not in terms of food and they are friends in other things. Now you can see that John and Harry have their Aadhaar cards. So this is my Aadhaar number and John's Aadhaar number looks something like this. So this is John's Aadhaar number and this is my Aadhaar number. Our Aadhaar numbers can never be the same. Or if you consider that we make friends, like my friend Tanya and John's friend Shruti. So their Aadhaar numbers will be different. And this is Tanya's Aadhaar number. Now this Aadhaar number will be different for everyone. So John and Harry were friends, John's friend Shruti, and this is Tanya's Aadhaar number. None of these numbers are the same. If I tell you any of these numbers, you will understand that I have said 35, 36, 35 and Harry is talking. And if I say 54, 56, 57, you will understand that Shruti is talking. And if I say 34, 56, 58, and 63, you will understand that Tanya is talking. So this Aadhaar number unites Tanya, Harry, Shruti and John. So this is their Aadhaar number, their ID. No one else will get this Aadhaar number. Along with that, let's say John and Harry spent their childhood together. They were both very tall and used to study in the same class. And the name of that class was Class 10. Let's say they were in the 10th class. Let's say. And Shruti is in Class 9. And Tanya is in Class 9. So both are in Class 9. Tanya and Shruti are in Class 9. So what is Shruti's Class? Tanya's Class can be 9. Shruti can't study alone in the class. Or Harry can't study alone in the class. So the class means that Harry and John are in one class. So can a person's class be multiple? A person's class can be multiple. Let's say Harry is in Class 10. And he goes to a tuition where he is in Class 10A. Let's say there are classes in that tuition. So there can be more than one class. One is Class 10. And one is Class 10A. And along with that, let's say Harry wears a red T-shirt. So his class is also red. So the class doesn't mean that he is not in the class. The class means that he is classified in this class. Let's say. Now let's come here. Let's leave John and Harry Shruti. Let's delete this. Let's zoom out and delete it. It doesn't mean anything. Now let's come to Index.html and understand this. Let's say I made a div here. And I gave it a class, red. And I made a span. And I gave it a class, red. Can I give the classes to different elements or the same class? Yes, I can. But if I want to put an ID in any element. Let's say I put an ID in its first div. I can put anything in the ID. So I can't give this ID to any other element. Because it's its Aadhar card. Even if it's a second div, I can't put it. Then I'll have to put something else in the ID. I put the ID in the second div. And I'll write second and first here. So this concept of ID and classes. I personally understood it very late. When I was learning WebLogopent in my early days. Nobody told me that ID unites an element. And the class can put multiple classes in one element. And can put only one class in multiple elements. Do you understand? If I gave it a red class. I can also give it a BGLO class. Okay, BGLO. I can give it only one class. And if we give multiple classes to any element. Then we can put space in it. Like if I want multiple classes to be put in this element. Then what will I do? First I'll write red here. Then I'll put space and write BGLO. So I can give multiple classes to the same element. Can I give multiple ID to the same element? Have you ever heard of someone's Aadhar card? I don't know if someone has made it from here and there. But there is no Aadhar card. Aadhar number is one of one person. And Aadhar number cannot be the same of different people. Okay. One person cannot have multiple. Different people cannot have the same. But the class. If I ask you to wear a t-shirt of any color. Or you can wear a red t-shirt of any color. No problem. You'll get it if you go on the road. And let us say you like mango. You'll get multiple people who like banana or grapes. So let's say they are in banana class. Or they are in grapes class. Okay. In mango class. So we can classify in one class. And we can give different elements to one class. So I hope you understood this. Now I'll write some CSS here. Don't say that you are not reading CSS. What I'm writing in CSS right now. You guys can think of it like this. I'm writing some alien language. Okay. Inside style.css. But I'm trying to make a point. I'll click here. And here you can see the preview. First and second. I'll show you one thing. I'll show you how to target a class in CSS. By putting a dot. Dot red means red class. And hash first div means. Hash means ID. Dot means class. Okay. If I say that the first div. Color the background red. Okay. So if you want to color the background red of the first div. Its background color will be red. Okay. These are the selectors in CSS. And now I don't want to confuse you. I can comment like this in CSS. Okay. But we'll read all these things later. Now what I'll do by doing dot red. I'll write background color red here. And along with that. What will I do in .bg yellow. Dot bg yellow will be mine. I have to put a dot. Dot means class. It means class bg yellow. And I'll make the background color yellow. Sorry. I'll make it color red. I won't make the background color red. Dot red means its color will be red. Look its color is red. And the background color is yellow. So this way you can use. I hope you understood this. Now one thing to note here is that. The ID and classes are only attributes of the element. This is ID attribute. And this is class attribute. So if I say what are ID classes. Are they elements or not. They are attributes of elements. Now there is one more use of ID. I'll tell you what is the use of ID. If I take you to Wikipedia and write coding. So this page of Wikipedia. I go to some other page. On a big page. So when you go to any page on Wikipedia. What you can do is. You can take the link of that particular place. I'll show you how it is done. I go to some other page. I scroll down. And here I'll inspect. I'll see its ID. This is its ID. So I'll copy its ID. And if I put a hashtag here. And this ID. Now I'll hit enter. So it will take me directly here. In ICDA 8. So if I put it in incognito. It will scroll down and show me that particular ID. It scrolls down and instead of showing me this. It scrolls down and shows me. Because it wants to bring me to this ID. So it works in linking too. So this is also an ID. Very few people will tell you. That you can generate links. If you come to any link. You can write ID by doing a hashtag. So when you open that link. It will focus on that ID. Like it is giving me in this case. You can see that as I hit enter. So maybe I did the ID wrong here. But you got the point. So it is 29.29. And I'll hit enter. So you can see that I'm down. If I open incognito or reload it. So you can see that I'm down. So I'll scroll up. And after this I'll open a new tab. And if I do this. So it's bringing me to the page where this ID is. So I hope that you understood the ID and classes. Through this video. ID means like Aadhar Card. Class means a person's property. Like he likes red. Or which class he is in. One element can be given multiple classes. One element can be red. And the background can be yellow. And the other element can be red. And the background can be yellow. So red class can be given multiple elements. You can give red class to fake element. And you can give red class to one element. Or you can give BG yellow class. So I hope that you understood. So that's it for this video. I was reading captions. And I laughed. So I told them to name me. And I laughed 5-10 times. Very fast. I told them to access. Name your village and my name. So do access the playlist. Do access the GitHub. Do like the video. And do write in the comment section. Hashtag sigma batch op. Thank you so much guys for watching this video.
