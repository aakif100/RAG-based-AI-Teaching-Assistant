    "text": " In this video, we'll see how images are made, lists are made in HTML and tables are made. So, like the video. I know very few people like videos on YouTube. But if you do, thanks to your support, I get the motivation to bring such free courses. So, let's go to the computer screen and start the 5th video of the Sigma Web Development course. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I'm here on my computer screen. As you can see, I want to tell you to bookmark getup.com slash codewithhari. In fact, bookmark this repository so that you get all the code. Secondly, click on the playlist and bookmark it. Click on start and click on save. Now, the first thing I'll tell you about is about images. What is image in HTML? So, what we'll do is we'll make a folder here. Here, you'll find the new folder named video5. And here, video5. You'll know this by clicking on shift right and open with code. This time, I'll speed it up a lot because I've already told you. But if you want to avoid seeing this welcome page again and again, then uncheck show welcome page on startup. And you won't be able to see this again and again. But what we're doing is we'll make index.html, we'll make some control, we'll zoom in by using mouse wheel, we'll toggle the screencast mode so that you'll know when and why I'm pressing which button. Now, I'll put an exclamation mark here and bring the image abbreviation. And I'll put a view word wrap here. You'll have to work hard to see it. You can see that the word wrap is closed. So, what will happen here is that the horizontal scroll bar won't come. Now, what I'll do is I'll write images here. First of all, I'll write images here. And I'll simply bring an image here. Now, you can bring an image from the internet. I'll write here, let's say we want to bring an image. Train key. Train key images. Because we've run a lot of train in this course. So, we'll bring train images. Why will we bring any other image? I'll save images. And here in sigma web development course, in the folder number 5, there's a CMS file. In fact, I'll do one thing. I'll cancel it. I'll take its SNP because it's a CMS extension. I'll go to PNG and take it. So, I've pressed Windows, Shift and S. It's a shortcut to snipping tool. If you don't know, then now you'll know through sigma web development course that if you press Windows, Shift and S, your snipping tool opens. If you don't know this, then tell me in the comments section. Now, what we'll do here is, I've done Windows, Shift and S. And I got into the conversation. So, you click here and save it. Here, the floppy disk option of save, you click here. And in downloads, in sigma web development course, we'll save it in video file. We've saved it in the name of image. Now, in HTML, there's an IMG tag. As soon as you put IMG, both SRC and ALT are its required attributes. In fact, you can also not write ALT, but it's recommended. I'll tell you what happens with these attributes. First of all, if you write in SRC, image.png. You can see this image here. And I'll put train image in ALT. Okay? Now, if I show you this in the browser, previewing, then you can see this. This is our page and this is the train image. What happened by doing this? Where did the ALT go? You can say, I'll tell you where it went. So, the thing we put in ALT, we didn't see it now. Let's say, for some reason, the server doesn't show you the image. What will happen then? Let's say I wrote image2 by mistake. Now, there's no file named image2.png. What will be the error? What will happen? I'll show you what will happen. So, ALT will be displayed here. And this kind of an error image will be displayed. Which will tell you that the image you've put, put it properly, you've done something wrong. Or the server URL you've given, there's no image there. These things are displayed like this. And ALT is displayed there. So, the user gets to know what's the purpose of this image. And if I come back here, you can put ALT in the image like this. If I don't put ALT, what will happen? If I don't put ALT, the ALT text won't show up. So, you won't want the user to see this image when your server error comes up. You'll want it to be like this. The user will see it like this. It's written in train image. You'll see it like this. I hope you understood this. So, the image is straightforward. There are two more attributes of it. Which are very important. One is width. Which is width in pixels. If I set it to 23, width is equal to, you can see. In fact, I'll fix the image first. I've written image2 by mistake. It's image.png. So, you can see here. I've taken 23 pixels. Which is very small. So, I'll make it 230 pixels. You don't need to write PX in this. When we write width in CSS, we'll see that we need to write PX. Or we just write width equal to double quotes in the number. As you can see. Okay? So, if I bring it here, you can see that we've seen this small image. If I give it the height, I'll give it the height. I'll give it the height as well. I'll say that if I keep its height 230, then its aspect ratio will also be reduced. So, it'll get a little stretched. Because it has made its width 230 and its height 230 as you can see. Now, if you want its height to be 230 and its width to be automatically adjusted, then you just use height attribute. Now, remove the width one here. So, its height will be 230 pixels. And it'll go as far as it can go in width. It'll automatically adjust. Now, look. It's automatically adjusted in width. And it took this in height. Now, what happens is that width and height can be adjusted through CSS. And we'll see in the CSS section why we should always set this width and height. We should always set one thing from width and height. Such that when our page is loading, then the image inside our page should not come out instantly. I'll tell you in the upcoming videos. But now you understand that these width and height attributes, I've heard that these are deprecated and should not be used now. But I say that they should be used for SEO purposes. Why should they be used? I'll tell you in the upcoming videos about core web vitals and SEO. For now, you can assume that width gives image to width, height gives image to height. If one of them is set, then the other one automatically sets. And these values are in pixels. And you don't have to write PX or pixel. You just have to write this number. And that's it. This is an attribute, height. And an SRC attribute, alt attribute. You can also use style attribute in this. In fact, you can use style attribute with almost all tags. So, this was about image. Now, we'll talk about tables in HTML. Table tags are very useful in HTML. I'll tell you what table tags are. You can see a table from table tags. Now, I'll copy this table from here. And when I copy this table from here, you can see my page will look like this. So, this is the table of HTML. Where is my preview page? Here it is. Here, you can see the name, HarryAge100. Now, if I add more things here, suppose I add something like this. Suppose I add name. And here I add, let us say, Harry's designation. Suppose I add programmer. And let us say, I want to add more things. I'll use alt shift bottom arrow key. I'll use alt shift bottom arrow key. And here, let us say, I want to write favorite language. And I want to write, suppose, JavaScript. And now, you can see, this table will look like this. Name, destination, favorite language. So, what is this? How does it work? I'll tell you. Let us say, we used table tag. Table tag has tr tag, which is table row. What will come in this row? You'll get to see this. Now, if you want to use this as table heading, you'll say, this is my table row. This is my row. Name, destination, and your favorite language. What will come in this row? And what will be that? Here, you can see, it will be a heading. So, I'll use th. Th means table heading. And we'll write it only once. Once we put the heading, then we'll put the data. So, we'll put td in table row. Which stands for table data. And here, all the rows you put in tr, your rows will be added. So, here, let us say, I write Sam, and this is also a programmer. And suppose, this is Java, its favorite language. So, these rows will be added below the table. You can see, these rows are added, added, added. With CSS, we'll see how it can be bordered, but it looks like a default. And yes, I know it's ugly, but you just understand, that table works like this. Now, there are rowspan and callspan attributes. Now, you see here, rowspan means how many rows your td will span. For example, let us say, I write here, I want Sam and programmer, first, I wanted to take one cell, Sam, then programmer. I want to write Sam in two cells. So, I don't want to write programmer, I want to write here, that call span is equal to 2. So, call span is equal to 2 means, that Sam will now take two columns instead. What does it mean? Sam will now take two columns instead. That means, Sam will look like this. Let me show you. So, it took this whole column instead. So, call span means how many columns will be bordered. By default, one cell will be bordered, but sometimes, one cell will be bordered by two columns. To demonstrate this, I'll explain it to you In Excel, you can understand that this is a table of HTML. Sometimes, I want to span two columns, one data. So, here we use merge cell. And here, let me write Sam. In HTML, this is done by using call span. Sometimes, we want to merge vertically. Let's say, I want to merge these two cells. There, we use rowspan. And with whom we'll use rowspan? We'll use rowspan with td, obviously. So, we'll use call span with td, and rowspan with td. So, we'll use rowspan with td. So, it'll span two rows like this. So, I hope you understood this. And when we'll make tables of HTML, you'll understand it better. But let me show you rowspan quickly. So, if I write rowspan as 2, and then I write another tr here, you'll see that this is how my table looks like. Now, to better explain this, I'll add a CSS style here. I'll add a style sheet here. And I'll name this style sheet as style.css. So, style.css. And you don't need to understand CSS. I'll tell you already. I'll write border in td. 2px solid black. And I'll tell you how it works. But for now, you'll understand that I've added this to explain it to you. So, I said that this row has Harry, programmer and JavaScript. Then I said that this Sam how much will be its rowspan? I gave it 2 rowspan. First, I said that my Java will have 2 rowspan. So, how many rows will Java take? Obviously, 2 rowspan. So, Java will take 2 rows. So, you can see that Java took 2 rows. So, when Java took 2 rows, it means I don't have to write Java in the next one because its row has already been surrounded. So, I'll not write Java in the next one. So, I'll not write Java here. I've added 2 rowspan for this. So, what happened by doing this? You can see that it was Harry, programmer and JavaScript. Then I said that this Sam will take 2 columns. This Sam will take 2 columns. And this Java will take 2 rows. So, you can see that exactly what happened. It took 2 rows and 2 columns. So, this is how you can use rowspan and callspan in HTML. In HTML table, we can add captions. And to add captions, we can use this type of caption. So, I'll show you that if we use caption in table student details or employee details then your page will look like this. You can see that employee details will be added here. Now, we can change its font size by using CSS. But for now, by default, it looks like this. You can also add header and footer. You can add Thead and Tfoot. You can add header and footer. For example, if I add some content in Thead and Tfoot, like this, if I add header and footer, then you can see Thead and Tfoot. You can see that header and footer are added here. Now, I'll tell you about another tag which is called brtag which adds line break. So, you can see that everything is down. So, this is header. And I'll add footer down here. I won't add it here. I'll add it after my table. So, this is my table footer. Now, I can change it by using CSS. Now, I can group my header and footer with Thead and Tfoot like this. So, what will be the header of my table? I can group this here. I can add it in Thead. Along with that, the content in the table will be added in the Tbody. So, what will be in the Tbody? I'll add the content of my table like this. And after this, if I write Tfoot here and I want to add some data at the end, then I'll add another TR. As you can see, I'll right-click it and document the format. So, it'll be a better format. Suppose, I want to add this kind of TR then I'll add the grouping method. I've added some TR in Tfoot, I've added the main body in Tbody and I've added it in Thead which is the header of my table. Obviously, there won't be any change. I've only grouped it. I'll write footer here so that you can see that it's footer. I'll write foot here. And you can see that the last row is foot. Now, what's the benefit of doing this? We've only grouped it so that we can target it from CSS. So, you'll use this very rarely. But you can do grouping like this. Your whole table will have head content and foot content here. Body content comes in between head and foot. But you can write it here. Ideally, head, body and foot. I hope you understood this. So, that's all about HTML tables. You don't need to know more than this. Now, we'll talk about list. List is very important in HTML because we'll use it a lot. There are 3 types of lists in HTML. There are ordered list, unordered list and definition list. Unordered and ordered list are the most used. Let's see unordered list first. Whenever we want to write unordered data like I'll write UL here. So, I'll write UL here which means unordered list. I can write Li in it. I can write Harry. After that, I can write Rohan. And after that, I can write Shubham. So, when I write Harry, Rohan and Shubham then I can write UL here. When I write Harry, Rohan and Shubham then I can write UL here. This is unordered list. Here, Harry, Rohan and Shubham are here. They don't have any order. But if I want it to be ordered then I can write it with the help of OL. If I make its opening, closing tag OL and keep the other things the same then it will be ordered list. So, here it will have 1, 2, 3. You can do ABC, you can do capital ABC, you can do Roman numbers, you can do all these. You can see here that I have written Li in UL so it came like this. You can see here that I have written Li in OL so it is 1, 2, 3. This is the example of ordered list. Definition list is rarely used. It is previewed like this. I have added heading and then I have written DL. DL means definition list. After that, DT and then DD. So, here definition term is there and this is the definition of definition. You can change CSS as well. It is rarely used. But you should know about it for interviews. If you ask about definition list then this type of code is previewed like this. I am not showing it for the sake of time but try it out. Here we will see the unordered list. I have told you about unordered list. It is very simple and straightforward. You can customize its bullet points by using type attribute. Let's write type is equal to square. I will write type is equal to square. Let's say I write square. I have written type is equal to square in the unordered list. It is previewed like square. Similarly, I can circle its type in the unordered list. I can square it and I can disc it. Disc is by default. I can square it and I can circle it. Along with that, you can add many other list items in the unordered list. Let's see the unordered list in a little more detail. In the unordered list, you can write li as 1,2,3 but you can use type is equal to i and you will get upper case Roman numbers type is equal to small i and you will get lower case Roman numbers type is equal to 1 is default and you don't need to do this. If you use small a, you will get alphabetical and if you use capital a, you will get upper case alphabetical. Let's try it out. I will use capital a. VS Code is giving us examples and suggestions and it is easier for us to see its possible values. VS Code is very useful and many people are using old editors which were used long ago. If you know their plugins and you are set in them, then you can use VS Code Modern. All the big developers use VS Code. You will see it using VS Code. If you want to code on mobile, I recommend Replet. I would like to give a shout out to Replet.com because I use it a lot and I think it is very useful. You can use Replet.com on your mobile if you don't have much computer power then you can use it. You will get templates in it. I will cover it in upcoming videos. I will stick to VS Code now. I hope you understood the ordered list, unordered list, definition list. We have completed 5 videos in the SIGMAP development series. I want you to comment in the first video and I will get the stars from the stars to know what is the initial review of this course. You have seen 5 videos. I know that after 1 minute of delaying my order I will get comments from Swiggy Zomato Delivery and many others. But still I want you to comment and tell me how is the course going. Go to the first video and keep writing SIGMAPACHOP in the comment. It gives a lot of motivation. This way we will have a two-way interaction. I will feel good if you keep commenting on me. I will give the source code in the description. You can access the playlist here. Like the video. Comment SIGMAPACHOP and name your village. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Bye."
