    "text": " Guys, we have seen almost everything in HTML. In today's video, we will conclude HTML and talk about some miscellaneous things which will help you in your web development journey. After that, we will start the CSS with the upcoming videos. I am concluding HTML. I am very excited. You guys like this video and write the sigma-patch-op in the comment section below. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, as you can see, I have come to my computer screen and without wasting time, I will create a new folder here which I will name as video 13. I will click on shift and right to open VS Code in this folder. And I will create a file called index.html. Okay. Now, I have created an index.html file here. Now, I want to tell you guys something. There are many things in HTML that you have to explore by yourself. I will tell you some things and I will conclude HTML after this video. If you want to write in HTML, let me toggle the screencast mode by turning on the word wrap. If you want to write in HTML, 3 is greater than 4. Okay. If you want to write this. If you try to write this in HTML, let me show you its preview. So, it has written 3 is greater than 4 here. Okay. Now, let's say I write here, this is the code for paragraph. Okay. And I write something like this. Now, I have written this here. Okay. I want it to appear here. But, you can see that it won't appear here. Why won't it appear here? Because how will it know that I want to write the paragraph code or I want to use this P tag as a syntax. So, HTML entities are used to avoid this. Now, let me tell you what HTML entities are. If you write here amp%lt semicolon, lt for less than, then you can write it as lt semicolon. Now, if you write amp%lt semicolon here and replace it with amp%lt semicolon, and the greater than is simple, you can replace it with amp%gt semicolon. Let me show you this. If you replace it with amp%gt semicolon, then what will happen is it will appear here as it is written. As you can see, let me zoom in and show you. Okay. So, what happens is that HTML entities are used to write things that may collide with HTML syntax. What does it mean to collide? If we write the paragraph tag code here, then how will HTML entities know that it is a paragraph tag code or you actually want to write this as it is. There is a pre tag for this. If you put anything in the pre tag and you write here then p thisisaperra. So, if you write it like this, then it will appear here as it is written. As you can see. It will appear as it is. And along with that, if you write new lines here, thisisafterfuenewlines. Okay. And some more. If you write it like this, then it will appear as it is. All spaces are intact. All new lines are intact. But here it's not like tags will show up. We'll have to use entities for tags. So, this is pre tag HTML. So, we've seen entities. We've seen pre tag. If you want to put a copyright symbol, then you can write amp% copy semicolon. And as you write amp% copy semicolon here, then you'll see a copyright symbol here. As you can see. Okay. So, you can do such things with the help of HTML entities. So, you can try out all these examples. Non-breaking spaces. Along with that, you can use special symbols like we've seen copyright. Amp% NBSP space is used. And it's very important. So, if I write here, copyright. Okay. I write copyright here. And suppose I want for some reason to see a lot of spaces here. And I write code with Harry here. Okay. So, if I write copyright code with Harry, then this space will be considered as a fake space. Because the extra spaces in HTML are ignored. So, if you see here, the code with Harry came immediately after the copyright. But ideally, we don't want that. What we want is that the spaces that I've put here should come. So, don't put spaces. You put amp% NBSP. The more you put amp% NBSP, the more spaces you'll get. You see here. These spaces are coming. So, whenever you want to put literally spaces in your HTML code, amp% NBSP is something you should go after. Okay. So, here, how to put these breaking spaces. And along with that, you can do the reserved characters in HTML, like less than, greater than, you can do all of these with HTML entities. After this, what is quotation tag? Quotation tag helps you to write quotations like this. I'll also give you an example of quotation tag. So, quotation tag works like this. And as you write here, this is quotation text here. So, what will happen is that search engines will know that you are actually writing quotations. Okay. And you can also style it with CSS. Then, you can put the URL of anything you want to cite. Similarly, you can also use the Q tag. Cite is equal to, you can put the URL here. Okay. So, you can cite any research article. Or there can be other reasons like if you want to cite Wikipedia, then you can use this tag. Okay. And you can obviously style it with CSS. So, these are our quotation tags. Okay. And HTML entities. Then, some HTML tags are obsolete. Like font tag has become obsolete. Because we handle font with CSS. We don't use font tag. There were many attributes in font like color, size. And you can use font tag like this. But it's not recommended that you use font tag. Then, center tag was helpful in centering things. But now, I'll recommend you that we'll center with CSS. Flexbooks, Grid, etc. Which will learn from modern CSS. So, all these tags are those about which you should know. But you should also know that you don't have to use them. Okay. I hope that helps. Then, code tag. The most important tag for coders. Like you're seeing this website, codewithery.com. Here, you're seeing that I've used the code tag. And if you're excited about this, then I'll tell you that I'm using a library called Prism CSS. Many people ask me. And how to do all these things, I'll tell you. Prism.js. This will help you highlight your code. So, you can put your code in your blog. I'm using this library. I'll tell you how to do all this. I'm also using React. So, we'll learn all those things later. So, don't worry. But if you want to write code, then you have to use code tag. If you go to its source code, and right click, then you'll see that any code is written in the code tag. I've put pre and then code tag. If you see below. So, if you find any type of code on my site, then it will be in the code tag. Okay. So, here you can copy the code, and then paste it and run it. So, you can also write multi-line code in pre. Why pre is added? So that the new lines are intact. For example, suppose I want to write a code here. Suppose I want to write a Python code. Okay. Or suppose I want to write an HTML code. I'll press Ctrl N. And I'll make it HTML. And I'll mark an exclamation mark and enter it. And I'll copy and paste it. And I'll write in H1, that this is HTML boilerplate code. Okay. So, if I preview this, then here this is HTML boilerplate code is rendered. If I want to write the code as it is, then I'll have to replace this less than sign. I'll write change all occurrences. And I'll do ampersand lts semicolon. I told you, lts semicolon. And along with that, I'll write the greater than sign and change all occurrences. ampersand gts semicolon. Now, I'll paste this code there. I can't do as it is paste. Okay. So, this is also very important. Now, it'll come here. So, here the code as it is is rendered. So, anyone who wants to copy can do it. You have to note one thing, because of the pre tag, these spaces are also coming. If you want these spaces not to come, then you select them. Press Shift and Tab. So, what happens with Shift Tab? An indent reduces. Okay. So, you can do this. And then, press backspace here. And I'll remove extra space from here too. And now, your code is rendered as you want. Okay. And you can style it with CSS. Prism will use CSS. I'll tell you how to use these libraries. There'll be a lot of things in the upcoming videos. But, I just wanted to tell you about some HTML tags that you should know about. Okay. Then, character sets. Character sets means which characters you're using in your page. Then, canvas. What is canvas? Basically, the use of canvas is done through JavaScript. But, you can understand canvas as an element in HTML which we use to make graphical shapes. Okay. I hope that you've got the complete information about HTML in this video. You must have got to know it by now. We'll do CSS with the upcoming videos. HTML is complete. I hope that you're enjoying it.
