    "text": " It is very important to learn the concept of inline and block elements in HTML Inline elements are those which take only the required width and block elements are those which take the entire width of the screen This is also called display property which can be set through CSS If you are enjoying this video then please like this video So let's go to the computer screen and see inline and block elements closely Through some very good examples Let's roll the intro So guys, it's time to see inline and block elements If you haven't accessed the playlist and code then you can access both Because as the videos are being made, the code of the videos is being added to the playlist Now what I will do here is I will create a folder called video8 I have already added 7 videos here I will create a video8 and open it in VS Code After opening the VS Code, I will get you guys to create an index.html And I will tell you about index and block elements So I typed in an exclamation mark and I could have typed this too But I won't because I can't type this And I will write here inline and block elements I have told you guys a little bit about this But I will tell you guys in detail about inline elements and why I want to use them So inline elements are those which take only the required width Don't block elements take the same width as inline elements? No, they say that they need the full width Some people are like that, they just spread and spread I will tell you guys the difference And to explain this difference, I will cheat a little bit And the cheating is that I will add CSS You might think that I haven't studied CSS, why am I adding CSS? I am adding CSS as much as it is necessary And here I will just do one thing I will write here P and enter And I will write here let us say hey I am a para And I will tell here to give background color to P Let us say blue I will give a nice color here You guys can choose a good color Now you can see here I have given a color to paragraph And along with that I will add an anchor tag href is equal to Google.com let us say And I will have to add HTTPS Then it will go to Google.com And I will write here Google And I will give the background color of anchor tag I will give background color red But not red, I will do hover And this way I can choose any color in the spectrum How did you like Ninja Tagging? Let me know in the comment section below If you already knew about Ninja Tagging, then comment I am already a ninja So you must comment here, it is very important Now you can see here I have given the background color of anchor tag And I have made it very similar I will change it a little bit, I will make it reddish I have made it a little red orange And this is blue Now you see the difference I will click here and as soon as I click here You see that the background color that he got He got it all the way But he got only as much as this element Why did this happen? This is because this is the paragraph block element And our anchor tag is the inline element Inline elements only take the same place as they want Block elements take the full width And the next content that comes is below them When we take the full width, the next content will come below them Along with that, if I talk about div What is that? A block element I am a block element And span is there Which is exactly like div But it is an inline element I am span and I am inline And after this, if I put an anchor tag And write yes he is inline So you see here See what happened Let me show you the code by zooming out So if I write it in a new line By the way, let me tell you how many spaces I give here This will not be added in my content Because HTML is more than one space It does not include it anyway If you want to give spaces Then you can either write ampersand nbsp I will tell you about it But now I want to show you how it works So see what happened I wrote here that I am a paragraph What is paragraph? A block element So he took the full width The next content will come below Ahref is equal to this So he took only the width as much as it is necessary And he took only this much width But the next content was saying that I need the full width So it will not come here It will come in the next line Because it says that I need the full width So it will come in the next line It cannot come in this line Because if it comes in this line, how will it take the full width? Google is also taking the width So it will take the full width If I give it a background color Then I will have to see it in full width Let me give it a yellow color Give it a background color And I give the background color yellow And you see here This yellow took the full width Along with that, I can keep the span and anchor tag in one line Because it is an inline element So it takes the same width as it is necessary And gives the opportunity to come to other elements in its own width As you have seen here This span also gave the opportunity to come to anchor tag Now will the anchor tag always be inline? Will the paragraph track always be blocked? Will this always happen? The answer is no You can change You can set the display property of any particular element from CSS And if you have set the display property Then it is not necessary that it will be inline It can also be blocked And the block element will be blocked It can also be inline We will see this in CSS later Now I would like to pinpoint something quickly That the forms video was video 7 But I have put it in the folder named video 6 So I will make it video 7 And now it is video 8 What we are doing now is video 8 And there is nothing in video 7 So I will quickly structure it here Don't worry about it I hope you are getting good learnings Many people have pointed this in the comments I will fix it But I think that doesn't affect us in any way Because you are understanding it And now the folder of source code that you will get You will get it right Along with that Go to codewitharri.com and click on notes And download the notes And it will become a complimentary source for you But I am explaining everything to you step by step So don't worry about it So this is our inline and block elements Now which elements are inline and which are blocked How will you know that How will you know that div is block and span is inline So this comes with practice But I have made a comprehensive list for you Of inline and block elements Here is the list of block elements In which I have written the most commonly used elements Like div is used the most Then there is paragraph And if you come to the end You will get such elements Which are not very useful Maybe you don't know about them But you will know about them later And it is not possible for me to tell you all the elements So you guys do some self-learning Definitely there are many elements Which will be of very little use to you But you will see the most commonly used Then I have made a list of inline elements So you can refer to this comprehensive list Here I have made a file called comprehensive list.txt So you can refer to this file Along with that, you should not have any unnecessary space in your code I was telling you that this space is not parsed In fact, if you right click and do format document Then your document will be formatted Write the code well Write the code so that when your grandchild opens your laptop And sees this code Then he will say that grandfather used to write good code Don't say that grandfather used to put such spaces Then grandfather used to do this Then grandfather used to do this So you will want to remember your code in good words So write your code well So that your grandchild hears good things from you Now here through html comments I want to give you a quiz What is this quiz Without using brtag write a vertically aligned form Asking for name city And I have added one more thing here I will show you I will turn on the word wrap Now here you see the name city and pin code of a user So write a form Which we read about in the last video You have to write this form How will you make it You should know And along with that I want everyone in the comment section To give an answer to this quiz This is our first quiz So I want you to make a two-way interaction Write your code in the comment section And do comment And tell me which element you used If yes, which inline element Which block element If yes, which block element You can tell me your explanation in the comment section In the coming videos we will see How you can set inline blocks and flex By using CSS And what is the difference We will see in the upcoming videos I want to tell you If you are following this course You will become a great web developer And don't think that Our videos are long And our hustle is going on for a long time I want you to be beginner friendly Whatever I am making Along with that I want to tell you People will tell you in life That you are doing this We are doing fun You are studying You are doing this You know what People will never tell you That you are blessed No one will tell you That you got a sigma web development course You are living in a time In which you are getting a comprehensive course In Hindi and free No one will tell you that you are blessed People will tell you That I am going to watch a movie You are studying What is this You are so boring People will tell you this But no one will tell you That you are blessed To find this course And you are blessed That you are watching You are blessed That you are not getting distracted And in the coming time When you will look back You will realize That how blessed I am I tell myself That how blessed I am That I studied in IIT JEE time I took out IIT JEE So much happened All things changed So no one will tell you this No one will tell you That it's worth the sacrifice That you are doing I am telling you That all the people who got success They have sacrificed their life Any name of anyone They have sacrificed somewhere They have made a big sacrifice And people will never tell you That this sacrifice is worth it So keep working hard You are going right Don't think that You are missing out Everything happens I should have got this advice 4 points I should have got this advice 4-500 rupees note Which I didn't get But no problem Let's move ahead Here I will do one thing I will add a color in the span So I will write span And I will add background color I will add any color I will add blue-violet I will reduce it a little By clicking Or by hovering Like this And if you will see It has highlighted it like this So that's it for this video I hope you have understood What is the difference On Inline and Block Elements Access the playlist Like the video Please also access the code Name your village Thank you so much guys For watching this video And I will see you Next time"
