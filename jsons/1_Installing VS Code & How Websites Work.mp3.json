will make your work very easy This course will be for those who don't know anything You know zero if this course is for you about web development We will start from zero but we will raise the bar later What we will learn in this course, I will tell you in a while Web development is a very profitable thing I have personally earned a lot of money through web development And I believe that you can also be very successful By learning web development During the course, you will be given notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things This course is going to be a little different Because I will tell you all the technologies that you should learn according to your experience And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies Course content will be complete web development, front-end, back-end, database I will teach you as much as you want I will tell you what the course content will be in a while But you have to believe that I will make you a full-stack developer You will be given many projects in the future During the course and at the end of the course, we will make some good projects So that your hold on web development becomes very strong According to me, project-based learning is the best way to learn So I will make many projects for you If you agree, then write in the comment section below I agree Because when you comment, I get a lot of spam So do comment I want to make you believe that after completing this course You will be able to make any kind of website from start to finish And during this course, I will make many such websites So that your confidence will go up a lot So let's start with the first video of our Sigma web development course Let's roll the intro Music Alright guys, I have come to my computer stream And now, as I am doing, you guys follow me as I am doing I have downloaded Google Chrome Browser You also download Google Chrome Browser I am not saying that it won't work But you guys have to do exactly what I am doing here So here we will follow exactly as I am doing And along with that, you guys will be able to follow the videos exactly I will go to Google quickly And I will write down download vs code Now what is this vs code This is a source code editor If I am in Windows, then I will click on Windows If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system Then you can download this for that operating system And the process will be exactly the same You can see that in my downloads folder Here is the vs code And as you can see here, this setup has been downloaded I will refresh it And here you can see the vs code setup I can double click on it and install it So simply, you have to install vs code It is as easy as installing a game You can read the agreement here This lies in upslice to the... ...damages And after this, I will accept the agreement You guys also read it like me And I am the fastest reader in the world Next, we will do next Here it is important to check both the icons It is very important to check both the icons If you want a desktop shortcut If you want a shortcut in the desktop Then click on create a desktop icon And then click on next And then click on install If your PC is as fast as mine Then it will be as fast as mine But if your PC is slow Then there is no problem It will be a little slow install Nothing more than this Now here I will recommend you To subscribe to the channel Because I want you to follow these videos Exactly as I do So that you get notifications So if you want to follow this course completely Ideally you should subscribe With that said, our vs code is downloaded I have opened my vs code Don't be afraid of this And I am saying this again If you already know these things We are taking a beginner friendly start In the initial videos But we will raise the bar like anything in the upcoming videos I will also request you To tell me in the comment section What is your level, beginner, advanced Or intermediate user Tell me in the comment section Where do you get web development Beginner, advanced, intermediate Please do comment here Now let's understand why we downloaded vs code So if you are a beginner And you don't know what vs code is Let me tell you that vs code is a code editor Which helps you in editing code Now you might think that I can edit code in notepad But I can also edit it in notepad I am not saying it in a sarcastic way But it can be done Let's set it up and see what is in it Which makes it different from notepad Let's set it up quickly I won't browse color themes I will do it I will keep my dark modern theme And I have done all this Next section After this, next section You can also close welcome But I am telling you some tips That's it Here you can see vs code It's a vs code screen You can create a new file Or a new folder But I will recommend you to close it Yes, close it Why did I close it I am going to create a new folder And I am going to name it You guessed it right Sigma web development course And we will do everything in this course We will do everything You can click on shift and right click If you are in windows You can see Open with code option This option Helps you to open This folder in vs code You will select it Now you will say Yes, I trust this file Click on it and say yes, I trust the authors And this folder is opened If I click on plus To create a new file Write it down If you don't know what I am writing Enter And then I will write Here I am Your first html file Suppose I wrote this Here you can see this dot This dot is white color This means you haven't saved this file Please save it If you hit control, it will be saved I will recommend you to go to file And enable auto save option You won't see this dot Your file will be saved instantly As you type I recommend you to do this Otherwise you can disable this option If you want to save it One more thing Click on gear Then on settings And search mouse Here you can see editor Check it And close it Now you don't have to worry About the vscode Why is this? You don't have to check all these Now if you click control And scroll Your font size will change Now I will show you a magic It's very simple Logic In downloads In sigma web development course folder This file is created index.html Which is very natural This folder is open in vscode Because I have opened this folder in vscode This file is also created I will create another file I will create a file named this.txt And type this is this This file will be created here This folder and this vscode Are running in sync Now if I open this file from notepad And I show you My file is opened in notepad I can do that too But I won't use notepad And I want to get those features I don't want to overwhelm you But I will show you What is in vscode Which you don't get in notepad If I type here html It will give me an opening closing tag If I type here exclamation mark It will give me a boilerplate template If I click on this The basic code of html is here We will discuss about this later Don't get overwhelmed by this But I want to tell you How this vscode was useful Why we didn't use notepad And why we used vscode And we get this feel Like developer feel, hacker feel That feel is also important That's why we get confidence to do coding Now I want to comment For mac and linux users Things that are going to be similar I am using windows I can't use 3 laptops Linux, mac and windows Things will be exactly same for you In fact Things will be similar Not exactly same, very similar You can follow along easily Don't get tensed I will tell you about some extensions You will enjoy using them And you will also say I enjoyed it, what I recommended But I will tell you in a while And this is criminally underrated I am telling you that you will enjoy Before that I want to tell you If you right click on command palette You will see many options For vscode You don't need to know all these As we will move forward in the course All the features that will be used I will tell you And you can use them But what I will do now I will toggle a screencast mode You don't have to do this But I will do it, you will know I clicked I will type anything You will know when I clicked Which button This is not relevant for you But I want to tell you That the screencast mode We can change The settings of the screencast mode Now you see here The vertical offset of the screencast mode What does it mean? If I make it 0 It will come up If I make it 70 It will come down If I make it 80 It will come down Which means From bottom it will be visible So I made it 0 Now I will type anything You will see it below So I will close this This.txt file I will close the settings tab These are tabs I hope you know What are these tabs What we have written I will tell you what these tabs are You can also close the welcome page Of VS Code By any chance if you want to zoom in I will do it because I am recording a video Ctrl plus numpad plus add I have shown you below I am zooming in because I am recording videos So ideally I want you To see the screen from a distance But when I am coding I don't zoom in that much So these are related to VS Code I want to tell you How VS Code works A website basically Works with 3 types of people Imagine 3 people One is client and one is server Who are client and one is server Who are server And third one is browser Which is also called Babu Browser So browser, client, server What is this client, server, browser I am client You, all of us Use browser Who is browser? This is Chrome Hello Chrome, I am client When I write code with harry.com Suppose I write code with harry.com So basically what I say I say With this browser Please give me code with harry.com website Or if I write youtube.com I say Give me youtube.com website I say browser Give me youtube.com You want to see youtube? Browser says you want youtube? Here it is So here I will enter youtube.com So from server Youtube.com brought it You understand From server youtube.com brought it And it showed me this screen This work happened so fast Because my internet speed is very fast Even this is less People's speed is also fast According to my locality It is very fast So with this fast internet speed All these things are getting very fast So client sends a request to server Through browser Browser is client's It will help me To bring this web page from server Who is managing server? Server is managed by youtube They are managing server of youtube.com And there is some code written in that server Which sends me this type of code When I write youtube.com This code is sent How to convert this code? This is browser's work So client says Give me youtube.com Browser says You want youtube? Wait, I will ask youtube.com Then browser goes to server It sends a request To server Server will give it Or it will say no Or it will say server error Whatever response Which should be 200 With that response Our browser Comes back to client And shows this type of page I hope this is clear to you Client, browser, server Client, browser, server Back to client So this is how this works This is more important When you write google.com Client, browser, server Browser says You want google.com? Wait, I will ask server Server goes to browser And gives you google.com Now along with google.com Server Sends images, videos All the things Like icons These icons have url in this code And that is also browser's work To display it properly Server sends a bundle To browser And it passes this bundle And shows it like this Now whatever further interaction User will send additional request To browser If I inspect it right And go to network And I write Harry So many requests For images So as you interact More requests will be sent To browser So you can think of it as a restaurant You gave an order As you gave an order A waiter took your order And sent it to your kitchen You can think of it as a server And when the kitchen gave the order Back So the waiter Which is working on browser Saw your order It might not be made in the kitchen For some reason You might not get it But it happens Sometimes you see error 404 error or 500 error Server is not working So whenever you see such error You get it But ideally 200 Ok response And you get this webpage So you can think of it as a restaurant So whenever you write google.com So google.com is available And if you write codewithhary.com So codewithhary.com If it's available 404 error So you get a page with 500 error And whatever server will send It will show you So this cycle is going on Client sent the request Browser sent the server Server processed the request And then server sent the browser And whatever data it sent Browser showed it to client Then client did something And server sent the same data to client Browser showed it to client So you might think that this is ok But what is back-end Back-end is how server Processes the request Now if you have a blog Which has a lot of data So what you will do You will store every webpage of blog Or you will dynamically generate That content I'll take google example If I search here So you can see here Google header Links, this format Doesn't change at all If I write here Shubham So as soon as I write Shubham When I wrote harry by It's content is showing similar So what google does Back-end of the server Back-end processes the data In such a way that it Sends this kind of HTML query So when I write Shubham Then it sends When I write harry by Then it sends So the process of generating this Is back-end Now this back-end can be Django This back-end can be Flask This back-end can be Node.js This back-end can be PHP This back-end can be Ruby on Rails And the database inside back-end is used So the back-end code is not visible to client This is front-end code which server sends So how it was created we don't know Because this code is running on server If you are confused then don't be You will understand everything We will see back-end later Now we understand how front-end works Front-end is primarily made With three languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript These are three languages Which are needed if you are Making a website Every website needs HTML, CSS, JavaScript In most of the cases When you use HTML It becomes a basic skeleton After that when you use CSS You can style it Like this button is visible So it is visible only because of CSS Along with that this button is visible Red or this button is visible Curvy like this This is all CSS This edge is visible So CSS is used to style A page What color will be the button All these things are done through CSS In a way, CSS is a beauty Of HTML page HTML is the existence of any page This is a standard Which is agreed Any website will be made on HTML So that browser makers can understand How to parse Browser's job is to parse HTML And HTML is a skeleton This is a standard Any website will be made on HTML Skeleton will use HTML This standard is made So that everyone can make the same kind of pages And if someone is making a browser Then they have to parse the same language If as a beginner you have learned 80% HTML Then you are good to go for web development Now some things happen directly From HTML Like if I write a quick HTML code Then I am writing HTML code like this I have used the exclamation mark And the Emmet abbreviation You don't have to worry About how I wrote this code I can open this HTML file Directly like this And as I open this HTML file Directly You can see It will open like this I can open it directly And it opened Now it says Hey this is HTML But it is not styled This HTML file is very basic Now you can run videos directly from HTML I have an HTML file Which I will show you Now let me show you This HTML file So that we can show videos So HTML has a video tag If we enter video Then the video which we will put in src will play Like if I put video 1.mp4 You can see the VS code has shown Video 1.mp4 This is the benefit of VS code So you can see here I will reload it So the video is automatically shown I can play it If I refresh it I will get the controls to play Now if I put video 2.mp4 I have put video 1 I have two more videos I have some more videos If I put it here And after that I will refer to them If I put video 2.mp4 Then you can see video 2 I will reload it And if I put video 2.mp4 Then you can see video 2 I will reload it So the video 2.mp4 I will reload it And if I put video 3.mp4 Then you can see the VS code So this was the lookalike of VS code Now if I put video 3.mp4 So the video 3.mp4 Then the video 3.mp4 Will play So I will reload it And you can see I can play it So the video 3.mp4 Is playing So I will close it And we can play video 4 also And video 4 is a DJ video In which DJ plays So you can see So you can make such things Only using HTML You don't need to do anything else You can play videos and images You can display videos and images All this can be done only with HTML Now if you want to style it Suppose I want to have a border Or a red background Then what I have to do for that I have to use CSS CSS adds beauty to any website Then comes JavaScript Which adds interaction To a website For example, what will happen when I click on search What will happen when I write code with harry Like I wrote code with har Then I have to use auto complete Why did I do this Because a request went to the server And for this query I got the results of auto complete So all these things are done with JavaScript This is called client-side scripting So if we want to do Client-side scripting Or coding Only on client side Then we can do it with JavaScript This is also called brain So our website is called beauty with brain So we added beauty with brain CSS added beauty And brain came from JavaScript JavaScript helps you to make the page dynamic Like if you want to change the content Without loading the page Then all this is done with JavaScript Here are a lot of mosquitoes So I will kill them Oh no, they are not getting anything from here My racket is working Oh my god Like the video because I eat current snacks for you So when I was in college I thought I have to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript one by one First learn 100% HTML Then 100% CSS Until you remember all the properties Then learn JavaScript But this is a wrong idea Why is it wrong Because you only have 80% HTML And only 40-60% CSS And JavaScript you can learn only 50-70% And start web development You can make projects And from there you can move forward Ok in this course I will tell you about the impact of web development So we will talk about this You guys stay tuned So never run after perfection About HTML and CSS Don't think that you will do HTML for one year Then CSS for the next year Then JavaScript for the third year Then make projects in the fourth year Don't think like that Do HTML 80% CSS 40-60% And you can make a great website And as you make the website This experience will teach you more HTML CSS and JavaScript And you will not even know that you have perfected HTML, CSS and JavaScript While you are making money And working as a professional web developer So you will be earning along with learning And also moving forward With your skills So never think that you will make a website Only when you remember all the HTML tags Only when you remember all the CSS properties Only when you remember all the JavaScript I will teach you this much So that matters I don't want you to learn for years That's why I have designed this course So that you can learn only what matters And you will learn the rest In practice And I will teach you a lot in this course Here we have some mosquitoes To learn the Sigma Web Development course Our audience is increasing In this course we will learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript And I will teach you some tricks Which you might have never heard before And I have learned some tricks I have taught you different tricks I will tell you in this course I have learned some amazing tricks In my career And I want you to learn them If you have any doubt In this course You can use the hashtag doubt And ask your doubt I am going to try to answer all the doubts I will try I will try to solve all your doubts So if you want to ask a question You can use the hashtag doubt And please don't put the hashtag doubt In the comments Write it without the hashtag doubt So that I can prioritize The comments with the hashtag doubt I will try to answer all the doubts As much as I can And you will learn everything in this course So like this course If you haven't done it yet That will bring a smile on my face Now what is React, Next.js, Angular So all these front end Frameworks help you To use JavaScript better Meaning HTML CSS is made from JavaScript And it helps you to make this process faster How? We will learn this in this course Yes, we will learn in this course I told you that I will make this course In a different way I will make you from zero to Hero in web development And tie your chair to your belt Because you have taken the ticket of Sigma Web Development Express I want to give you a good analogy To teach HTML CSS and JavaScript So JavaScript is like a car skeleton After that, you paint it with CSS And if you put it in an internal engine car Then it is JavaScript As an example of a human The skeleton is HTML After that, if you put skin and everything Then it is CSS And if you put brain, then it is JavaScript Now I will take you to Forbes.com As soon as you go to Forbes You will see a website And Forbes.com is a website Which uses HTML CSS and JavaScript Just like any other website Now if I click on right click And inspect Then this inspect element is opened Now here you can see that they have used Script in the head And to add CSS They have used link So what I will do here is I will remove CSS from here So to remove CSS, simply I will clear all their style tags By using delete key So as soon as I remove all these style tags And also all these link tags So as soon as I Delete all their stylesheets See what happened to this page This page looks like this They only have raw HTML What should be the size of the images And only raw HTML is written here Which has not been styled at all So Forbes.com looks like this Without CSS Without CSS, they are showing only raw buttons Raw text Raw links And similarly I can see without JavaScript How this website will look Now if I delete HTML tag Like this I have deleted all this So this is a blank page So without HTML, it is not there So this is the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript In making a web page I want to tell you that this course was initially made to be paid But I changed my mood And converted it into a free course And I thought I will upload it on YouTube So I want you to be serious Many people reached out to me To launch this course as a paid course But I was feeling that this course should be kept free Because when I was learning web development I can understand When you don't have a course to learn And you don't have affordability to buy a paid course So I can understand And I decided that this is a sigma web development course It should be absolutely free of cost This course is free But as soon as you earn millions You will earn crores You will give me tea, coffee, parties And all the gifts This is our agreement in this video So when you start earning crores Then send me a green leaf Or maybe a red leaf But you have to do this only when you start earning good Only after you start earning good So keeping you aside, in the next video I will tell you how you can earn money To complete this course I will put a light on this Because this is also important And that's also important How I do freelancing How clients come I will tell you everything in this course I want to tell you some action items The first action item is to access this course playlist Which I will give you in the description Everyone bookmark that playlist Press the star button here And then press the star button And save the playlist Many of you said that the course is paid And we will buy it Thank you so much for all the support I am encouraged by your support But this course is going to be free Now there should be no technical issues I am putting all these videos In 1080p resolution So you should see it very clearly But many people say That the video is in Sd 240p 144p You watch Bali's Wadu You finish the internet of Jio And watch Bali's Wadu from morning to evening And then you tell me that your videos are not in HD Call some Nagarpalika I hope you understood the request and response In this video How all these websites work We got a basic idea How client-server interaction works In the coming videos We will see how the website is made We are going to make our first website in the next video So you should be very excited Because in the next video Our first website is going to be made And many of you may be the first website So access the playlist Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time"
