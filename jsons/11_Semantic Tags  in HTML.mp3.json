    "text": " What's up guys, you guys are here in 11th video We have completed 10 videos in sigma web development course So 1 like is enough for everyone's consistency In today's video we will see about Semantic Tags Because SEO is very important And to understand the overall website structure Search engines are very happy to see this structure That means overall SEO of your website will be very good If you use these tags What are these tags, why are they there, how to use them What are the benefits we will see in this video Let's go to the computer screen Let's roll the intro So guys, first of all I would like to tell you about Semantic Tags Here you can see that I have made a folder named Video 11 And here I have set the title of the index.html boilerplate template And set the image of the h1 and I am going to preview it here So this is the image, to explain a little bit I will tell you what are Semantic Tags Semantic Tags is a tool that tells the browser and web crawlers Which wants to understand your website properly And tells them what is the content of your website And what is the purpose of the tag Even if you don't use Semantic Tags in html Then also your work will be done It's not like if you don't use Semantic Tags Then your website will not look good You can do a good job designing your website But we want to explain Google and Bing search engines About our website And if we explain them about our website Then they will understand our website And they will rank our website on Google, Bing And respective search engines And we want crawlers to understand our website And we want that whoever wants to understand our website They can understand it properly There are many tags like header, nav, main, article, figure These are all special tags in html Which helps in structuring your website Now if there is something in header Then I know that it's header, it's top If there is something in footer, then I will understand That the website has started ending and the footer has started This footer could have been div But no, if I am using Semantic html Then I will not make my navigation bar in span tag This time I will not make my navigation bar in span tag I will make my navigation bar in nav tag So these kind of differences Explain our search engines very well About our website So I will show you some examples of Semantic Tags And I hope you understood what Semantic Tags are Now there are download folders of our computer So download folder is like All the files of the world are in that folder 90% of your computer files are in download folder But we should not do this Some people go to the extent that they start Spreading files in their local disk C And some people keep files in system32 So if you spread your files In your computer, then it definitely Doesn't work in one way But if you arrange your files in folders If you want to keep secret files in a folder Then you can put secret files You can make a folder called do not open this If you can put your files in it It will be arranged in one way You have arranged your images in one way You have arranged your videos in one way So to understand this, it will be better That folder structure instead of If you are spreading your files throughout the computer You definitely don't want to spread your files So I hope you understood why we use Semantic Tags It is very good for SEO I haven't used the word SEO yet But SEO is a very important part of search engine optimization To use Semantic Tags So I make my website the way I make it You use some special tags For example, let's say I am making this website I will comment out the image What are Semantic Tags I will make a navbar First of all, I will say this is my website header I will make a nav in this I will make an unordered list I am writing a lot of things And this is my header So anyone who comes to my website will understand This is my header, home, about, contact I can write whatever I want This is my header, navbar, nav tags I will write about here And I will write contact here So I wrote home, about and contact So you understood this Now if I want to make a footer I will use main tag And then I will write in footer Copyright, CWH And here I will write All rights reserved So here I have written Copyright, all rights reserved So I will cut this And put it in main camera So first my header, then main content, then footer And here also, this is my header, this is my main content So I arranged it in one way Like you arrange your files in different folders I arranged my HTML tags So we understood about header tag It is used to represent the top section of a web page So here we will put article, which is the navigation menu In nav tag Article indicates a self-containing piece of content Such as blog post or news article If you put a self-contained piece of content, then put it in nav tag Section, it represents a thematic grouping So if one section is talking about one thing Then the other section will talk about something else Aside, means if anything is on one side, then it uses aside tag So here, typically used for sidebars and content that is tangentially related to the main content So here, typically used for sidebars and content that is tangentially related to the main content Like what you can do on aside tag is You can put a side note, about the author, you must have seen many blogs In which it is written about the author So you can put such things with aside tag Then we have footer tag, I have told you about it If you want to put copyright information or if you want to put some important links Then you can put it in footer After that, figure and ficcaption If you want to use images, diagrams, charts Then you can use figure and ficcaption Main content area, like the main content area of our speech We put it in main tag Then time tag is also used to represent time related information So you can use time tag, you can put date, time or anything in it So I hope you have understood this thing So these are used to enhance SEO These are used to enhance SEO, to improve accessibility And browsers want to take a decision about our page Let us say there is a browser That has created a new feature That will read our content, like the feature in Edge So browser can decide that I am only allowing the main content Now think, if someone wants to read this page, how will they allow it? Code with airy, home, code sys, you will not want to allow it You will want to read the main content So you will read the content, like html, semantic tags html5 introduce, arrange, semantic tags The first versions of html did not have semantic tags Semantic tags were introduced from html5 And the most important reason to introduce semantic tags in html5 Is to arrange things So that the content that is parsing Or the content that is watching the content Whether it is browser, crawler, google, bing, search engines Or anyone who wants to generate a preview Like you put a URL on twitter If there are such things You will want to understand your content So if you want to understand your content You will use semantic tags Or this image is explaining very well That without semantic tags, if you write html like this Then you will write like this This is a header, this is a nav, this is an aside How to throw something aside, we will do it with CSS Don't get confused, this is not used for styling Because many people get confused that This is not used to do things aside You will have to style things with CSS But here your content can be understood Described, what is the main content, header or footer That's why semantic tags were made Semantic tags are not magic, they are made for accessibility And to understand your content Here are some examples that you can see I have given you an example of header and footer tag What will happen inside the header Or you will put your navigation bar inside the header And you will style it with CSS I will show you a quick styling But many people will be confused If you want to horizontalize your navigation bar I will write some CSS here I have flexed the display So many things will happen in the upcoming videos So don't get tensed I will tell you everything And what does this CSS mean I will tell you about this too I will reload it, why it is gone, we will see it in the CSS section If you haven't access to this playlist, do it Click here and save I am uploading all the code So as you move forward in the videos You will get all the code video-wise And like the video Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time Thank you"
