    "text": " In today's video we will learn how to use audio, video and media elements in html In our very first video we saw that we can embed videos in html Today I will tell you how to play the video How to keep the video muted And how to enable and disable the video controls Along with that we will see about audio closely How to show media in an overall page So do like this video and stay tuned Because the examples I have used for video tags are very interesting Let's go to the computer screen and roll the intro Friends, this time I have made a folder named video10 And I will not waste your time by opening the code and clicking shift right Infact I will make it in index.html And the topic of today's video is video How to play video in an html file How to insert video, audio and media So adding video is very straightforward I will copy this video tag which has an src attribute And there are some other attributes of this tag Which I will discuss with you guys But first of all I would like to tell you that Video src is equal to video.mp4 So if you have video.mp4 then it will play So let's see I have added video.mp4 And I will preview it by clicking here And you can see that the video is ready Now this is a very big video So what can I do? I can give its width So I can say that width is equal to 555 pixels And as soon as I do 555 pixels Infact I don't need to write px I will just do 555 As soon as we don't need to write px in image We don't need to write px here as well So as soon as I do width is equal to 555 I will do a thing I will do height is equal to 555 So that it becomes smaller Infact I will make it smaller I will do 255 And you can see it has come here Now I will play it Look here, there is a good road from America What's your name? Kupendra Jogi Where have you been in the US? I have been to many places in the US What's your name? Kupendra Jogi So you can play video like this Now there are some attributes of video tag It's very easy to use video tag You should have a video You have to give a path of video After that you have to select controls So you will get these controls You can download it You can full screen it You can mute it You can do picture in picture All this is provided by your browser But let me tell you about some attributes First attribute is src So you must be knowing that Put a video here The name of the video file is src This video file can also come from external url If I have uploaded a video on Amazon s3 I can also put the url there It's not necessary that the video file can be on your computer or server It can also come from third party Now what are the controls? Adds video controls Like play, pause and volume Which we have seen in the video That you are getting the controls here Now the browser automatically sees What will be the control and what will not be in your video Then it will automatically play As soon as the page is loaded So let me put auto play here Now you can see what is happening So you can see that it has auto play So I will remove auto play And the next attribute is loop Which means once our video is played It will loop As I show you So it has started again Once I have finished it It has started again So this loop works like this So you can see that it has started again So you can see that it has started again So you can see that it has started again The next attribute is muted Muted makes the video mute So if I write here Sometimes we want the video to be muted In fact when I add videos here On codewithdry.com And I demonstrate something Like downloading VS code I use the muted attribute Because I don't want the background noise To be heard when I record the video For example I want to show you That this is the element So I will scroll down and highlight it So you can use the muted attribute In your website Then poster, poster is very important So I have an image here Download.jpg If I write here Poster is equal to download.jpg So you can see it looks like this If I play it in the poster The video will play So thumbnail, you can see the thumbnail Of the YouTube video So you can use these attributes Width and height This is the dimension of the video As you can see I have written width and height So I hope you understood this Now After this I want to tell you about audio So this is for all the video attributes It is very straightforward I want you to make a website Which I will give you at the end of this video In a quick quiz So do listen to the quiz I will put the heading here So that I don't forget And this is going to be a fun quiz And everyone should solve this But before that As you write audio You will get src And I will put it in Sachin.mp3 So I will put it in Sachin.mp3 And I will reload it And there is no audio here Which is strange I will put src is equal to And I will write controls So if I don't write controls I won't see audio I will play this audio Sachin what is Sachin Don't ask Sachin So this is our audio If I mute it It won't work So this is Sachin.mp3 audio Now what we will do We will see some audio attributes Src is the source of video file Then controls You know play, pause and volume Which we just saw What will autoplay do? I will automatically play Sachin what is Sachin Don't ask Sachin So what will happen by autoplay Our audio will be automatically played After this Next attribute is loop What will loop do? It will repeat it Sachin what is Sachin Don't ask Sachin Once, second time So you saw it repeated Once it was saved Because I was looping audio So you saw it Sachin.mp3 looped Once it was saved Then it was saved Sachin what is Sachin Because mp3 will be played again and again So there are many use cases When you want mp3 to repeat If you want your mp3 to repeat You can use it After this Muted will mute audio Definitely you don't want Your audio to be muted But sometimes we want The audio to be muted And we can tell the user Who wants to listen Sachin what is Sachin We do this with multiple audio You want to show 5-6 audio together You can mute them The user can play and see So you have control You can use it if you want So I hope you understood this You must have enjoyed A preload The most confusing attribute That's why I have explained it in codewithhari.com Preload attribute Can be these values First value is none This is the default value Preload means If you want the browser To fetch the data Then you will use preload attribute Otherwise you won't use preload attribute Preload is equal to none Preload is equal to metadata Browser will only preload Metadata Information about the audio file It will preload it Auto will preload the entire audio Preload is equal to auto It will download automatically And automatically load So that when the user plays The audio will be saved So this is the preload attribute In interviews we are asked What is preload attribute Before moving forward I want you to share this playlist With your friends As I see the interest is declining As we are moving forward I request you to like this video And as you are Forging this repository Keep it a star Your likes and star will help me In getting these kind of preloads So this was about audio and video tags I have explained all the attributes And you must definitely use it I will give you all the images So that you can try it out Many people were asking Can we use replit I haven't used replit in this course But replit.com is an amazing website If you want to use it On your phone If you want to run HTML There is a replit app for iOS For Android So you can try it out Many people are asking How to record on phone And how to use it I thought of making videos on VS code But I personally use replit a lot In fact videos are also available in replit Next topic is SVG Related to Media SVG is a format Where you can create High graphics Vector images So you can copy And make circles SVG is used in the same way As our IMG So if I type SVG It will come here So you can see the circular SVG Here Video, audio, SVG These are inline elements So we can see them in one line Now what is here You can save SVG file separately You can save SVG file separately Like if I write IMG.svg And save SVG content So if I write IMG I will write it like this And I will write IMG.svg So you can see here That I didn't get to see this If I write alt And write my SVG image So you can see here My SVG image came like this But I didn't get to see SVG Why did this happen? Because SVG file I write in browser And whenever you want to see SVG file In browser You will put a declaration I will show you So I wrote SVG file not showing So here is an answer of stack overflow Which will tell you So you have to write this I will show you You have to add this This is namespace declaration So you have to add this SVG And now you see here This is SVG This is very important And whenever you make websites You will get stuck in this problem I will keep getting stuck So I am telling you I told you the problem you will get stuck in You didn't get the problem I told you the problem and the solution Next topic is iframes Iframes is very simple You can embed another website Like if I want to embed this webpage I can use iframes like this So see This is mandli iframe And I will copy this url And paste it here And you see here This website is embedded in iframes You definitely want to embed this in big iframes But if you want it to be embedded You can do it like this I will increase its height Width is equal to width Let's say I write 122 Height is equal to 444 Ok So see it came like this Now definitely this width Was coming in this line Let's increase it 3 to 2 Ok So see my website is embedded So you can embed a website Another use case of iframes is YouTube video If you want to share a youtube video And click on embed It will give you iframe code And you can start it here If you want to start at a particular time You can do it here The point at which you will start I will show you Let's say I want to start from here Let's say I want to start from here So I will click on share After clicking on share I will click on embed I will start at 1219 And I will copy it And I will put it in my code So I will comment this iframe And I will put the iframe below I will word wrap it So you can see the code So now what I will do I will show you the document See the video is embedded So I hope you understood This And media in HTML is only this Pretty much Miscellaneous in every topic But that's all about media In HTML audio, video, media This is what you will use 95% of the time Now I will give you a quick quiz And your quick quiz is Create a website Which shows videos of different categories And audios of different categories Which shows videos of different categories You can use YouTube videos In an iframe Using YouTube's embedding feature So what you have to do You have to create a website In which you will get a lot of content Now you can use video audio tags And YouTube's share feature The way I embedded this YouTube video You can embed it in the same way And you have to create a very good website And show it to me You can comment on the getup And you can also tell me the code And explain it But do try this quiz And do write sigma batch op in the comment section Do access this playlist And like the video Do write sigma batch op That's all for now Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time Thank you"
