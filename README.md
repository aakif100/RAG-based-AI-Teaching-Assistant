# RAG-based-AI-Teaching-Assistant
<!--
add the audio and video details why did in .gitignore
tell what is the project about
tell about whsiepr openai model used and in that used medium model , switched from small.. you can you use large-v2 (best one)
tell about faster-whisper used ( 4x faster and less vram usage)

tell about be careful about cuda.. tell best to downlaod cuda 12.9 (13 is latest , but still it is not quite compatible as its new release) , and graphic driver needs to be above 520 i suppose
, best to download 560 or the latest one (570) and download cudnn latest one of v9 also , as cudnn is required for deep learning.. so cuddn . cuda and driver must be compatible with one another
so like i told downlaod cuda 12.9 , driver 560 and cudnn v9.. it works well

also ensure gpu theres no high usage from other applications (if any auto start is there , terminate/disable those)
