# RAG-based-AI-Teaching-Assistant
<!--
add the audio and video details why did in .gitignore
tell what is the project about

also important thing is add the commands aswell like  , whisper github command , ffmpeg install to path , pytorch+cuda and driver requirements and all ok.. for project to run you need it right.. so make it all documented

tell about whsiepr openai model used and in that used medium model , switched from small.. you can you use large-v2 (best one)
tell about faster-whisper used ( 4x faster and less vram usage)

tell about be careful about cuda.. tell best to downlaod cuda 12.9 (13 is latest , but still it is not quite compatible as its new release) , and graphic driver needs to be above 520 i suppose
, best to download 560 or the latest one (570) and download cudnn latest one of v9 also , as cudnn is required for deep learning.. so cuddn . cuda and driver must be compatible with one another
so like i told downlaod cuda 12.9 , driver 560 and cudnn v9.. it works well

also ensure gpu theres no high usage from other applications (if any auto start is there , terminate/disable those)
